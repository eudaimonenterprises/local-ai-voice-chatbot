# 🧠 Local Voice ChatBot with LLM + Whisper + TTS

A personal and fully-local chatbot with both **text** and **voice interaction**, designed to run entirely offline — no internet, no API keys, no cloud access required. 🛡️

Unlike typical chatbot solutions that rely on external servers or APIs, this project is built with **privacy**, **speed**, and **customizability** in mind.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Over the past months, I've explored many open-source and commercial **Local AI Chatbot** projects, analyzing trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and system resources. The goal of this project was to:

- 🧠 Use the **most efficient and lightweight LLM** available for text generation  
- 🔊 Integrate a **natural-sounding, fast Text-to-Speech** (TTS) model  
- 🎙️ Add **speech input** support using small but powerful STT models  
- 💻 Run 100% locally — great for offline assistants, personal use, or edge devices  
- 🧩 Provide clean, modular Python code to expand or modify with ease

After testing many models and options, I selected the following:

- **LLM**: [`lukey03/Qwen3.5-9B-abliterated-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/lukey03/Qwen3.5-9B-abliterated-GGUF) — a highly optimized instruction-tuned model, fast and accurate even on consumer GPUs.
- **TTS**: [`Kokoro-82M`](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) — a lightweight yet expressive voice model with speaker selection (British, American, male/female).
- **STT**: [`Whisper-tiny`](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny) — small and surprisingly accurate for transcribing English speech.

## ✨ Cool Features

- ✅ **Prompt customization**: define assistant tone/behavior with a simple string
- ✅ **Voice selection**: switch between dozens of speakers for TTS (e.g., `af_heart`, `am_michael`, `bf_emma`, etc.)
- ✅ **Typing animation**: bot simulates thinking with a "typing..." animation
- ✅ **Streaming voice playback**: no `.wav` files saved, audio plays in realtime
- ✅ **VAD support**: automatically detects when the user has stopped speaking
- ✅ **Chat history**: short-term memory with logging to `chatlog.txt`
- ✅ **Modular config**: all models and settings live in `config.json` for easy tweaks
- ✅ **100% offline**: you can even disconnect Wi-Fi and everything will work 🚫🌐
- ✅ **Added LM Studio API Support**: in speech-to-speech mode
- ✅ **Short-term Memory**: Short-term memory enables entire conversations.

This project is ideal for:
- 🧑‍💻 Developers who want to build or prototype voice assistants
- 🧘‍♂️ Privacy-conscious users who don’t want to send data to OpenAI/Gemini/etc
- 📚 Learners who want to understand local LLM + TTS + STT integration in Python

## 🛠 Configuration

The `config.json` file holds all model settings, like model IDs, temperature, speaker voice, etc. Example:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "model_id": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "max_new_tokens": 150,
    "do_sample": true,
    "prompt_behavior": "You are a friendly and polite assistant who always replies clearly."
  },
  "tts": {
    "model_id": "hexgrad/Kokoro-82M",
    "speaker": "af_heart"
  },
  "stt": {
    "model_id": "tiny",
    "language": "en",
    "energy_threshold": 300,
    "pause_threshold": 0.8
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Fully Offline After First Setup

All models used in this project are **downloaded automatically on first run** and cached locally on your machine.  
After the initial download and setup, the chatbot runs **completely offline** without requiring any internet connection or API keys.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** The model files can be large (up to a few GB), so initial setup may take some time and bandwidth.
